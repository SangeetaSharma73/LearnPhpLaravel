The .env file is a configuration file used to manage environment-specific settings for applications. It is commonly used in various programming environments, including Laravel, Node.js, and others. The .env file helps separate configuration settings from the codebase, allowing you to manage different configurations for different environments (e.g., development, testing, production) more easily.
