# Cache in Laravel:
- Caching helps speed up the application by temporarily storing data, reducing the number of database queries or expensive operations. Laravel provides a unified API for various cache backends like file, database, redis, memcached, and array.

# Cache Storage: You can store, retrieve, and delete cached data.
1. Storing data: Cache::put('key', 'value', $seconds);
2. Retrieving data: Cache::get('key');
3. Removing data: Cache::forget('key');


# Use Cases:

- Caching database query results.
- Caching configuration or settings.
- Storing API responses temporarily.
