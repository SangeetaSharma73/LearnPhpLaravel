## Redis

**Redis** (Remote Dictionary Server) is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker. It is known for its speed and versatility.

### Features

- **In-Memory Storage**: Redis stores data in memory for fast read and write operations.
- **Data Structures**: Supports various data structures like strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, bitmaps, and hyperloglogs.
- **Persistence**: Offers options for data persistence, such as snapshots (RDB) and append-only files (AOF).
- **Replication**: Supports master-slave replication for high availability and scaling.
- **Pub/Sub**: Provides publish/subscribe messaging capabilities.
- **Transactions**: Supports transactions with commands to execute multiple operations atomically.
- **Lua Scripting**: Allows execution of Lua scripts for complex operations.

### Use Cases

- **Caching**: Frequently used to cache data to reduce database load and speed up data retrieval.
- **Session Storage**: Commonly used to store session data in web applications.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Suitable for applications requiring real-time analytics and counters.
- **Message Queuing**: Useful for message queuing systems and pub/sub messaging.


1. Installation
[Download the Redis](https://redis.io/insight/#insight-form)



************************************ not implemented and what do we do next
1. Step 3: Install the Redis PHP Extension in Laravel
- Install predis or phpredis:

- Laravel provides two drivers for Redis: predis (a PHP library) and phpredis (a PHP extension). You can install either one, but predis is easier to set up.

- To install predis:

- Run the following command in your Laravel project directory:

bash

`composer require predis/predis`

- Alternatively, enable phpredis:

- If you want to use the phpredis extension, you can enable it in your php.ini file by uncommenting or adding:

ini

`extension=redis`
- Then, restart your web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx).

2. Step 4: Configure Redis in Laravel
Open the .env file in your Laravel project and add/update the following Redis configuration:

REDIS_CLIENT=predis
REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PASSWORD=null
REDIS_PORT=6379

- Open the config/database.php file and ensure Redis is configured correctly. Laravelâ€™s default Redis configuration looks like this:

php

'redis' => [

    'client' => env('REDIS_CLIENT', 'predis'),

    'default' => [
        'host' => env('REDIS_HOST', '127.0.0.1'),
        'password' => env('REDIS_PASSWORD', null),
        'port' => env('REDIS_PORT', 6379),
        'database' => env('REDIS_DB', 0),
    ],

],
5. Step 5: Test Redis in Laravel
- You can now use Redis in your Laravel application. To test if Redis is working, you can try caching a value:

Open a controller or route and add the following code to test Redis:

php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache;

Route::get('/redis-test', function () {
    Cache::store('redis')->put('key', 'value', 600); // Store key for 10 minutes
    return Cache::store('redis')->get('key');
});
- Navigate to http://your-app-url/redis-test in your browser. If Redis is working correctly, it will return the value value.

That's it! Redis is now installed and configured for use with Laravel on Windows.


## Redis correct Installation and connection with project 

# Redis
### Connect the redis with laravel
1. set this in .env
    - REDIS_CLIENT=predis
    - REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
    - REDIS_PASSWORD=null
    - REDIS_PORT=6379
    - 
    - FILESYSTEM_DRIVER=s3
2. add predis as depandency
    - composer require predis
3. then define the routes in web.php
    - 
    - Route::get('/redis',function(){
    -     Redis::set('todo_test', 'Hello, Redis!');
    -     return Redis::get('todo_test');
    - });
    - 
4. if still not working so go to the database.php of config and update the redis
5. check the proper connection with docker
