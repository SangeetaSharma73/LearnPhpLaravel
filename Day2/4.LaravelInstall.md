# laravel install

1. select the any of path 

2. open  the cmd 

3. In that path there is no comphar.phar file so you need to write all four lines otherwise no need to write(if comphar.phar file exit)


 - for installation we have to paste 4 lines in cmd
    - [Get those Lines](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"

php -r "if (hash_file('sha384', 'composer-setup.php') === 'dac665fdc30fdd8ec78b38b9800061b4150413ff2e3b6f88543c636f7cd84f6db9189d43a81e5503cda447da73c7e5b6') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"


php composer-setup.php

php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"





4. write  `dir`
  - give all four line of composer.phar 
  
5. use any of version of php 

6. I have used php8.2 

7. composer.phar create-project laravel/laravel `projectName`


8. like as : 

php8.2 composer.phar create-project laravel/laravel hello-world

* create project
    - using specific version
        - ex. php8.2 composer.phar create-project laravel/laravel hello-world
    - with default version
        - ex. composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app




# If error occur :  
* make the php.ini file 

1. php.ini file
    - if php.ini file is not present so copy the php.ini - development file and paste
    - then rename it as php.ini

2. inside php.ini file most of all extensions are commented so uncomment the require extensions.

    * uncomment extensions:
