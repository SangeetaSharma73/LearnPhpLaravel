# Structure  of laravel project 
- A typical Laravel project is structured in a way that organizes the application’s code into different directories and files, providing clarity and separation of concerns. Here’s the basic structure of a Laravel project:

│   ├── Exceptions/      # Application's exception handling
│   ├── Http/            # Controllers, middleware, and requests
│   │   ├── Controllers/ # All the application's controllers
│   │   ├── Middleware/  # Middleware classes

# Key Directories and Files:
1. app/: Contains the core logic of your application (controllers, models, middleware).
2. config/: Holds all the configuration settings for your app, such as database, mail, and queue.

3. routes/: Defines your application’s routes. There are separate files for web routes (web.php), API routes (api.php), etc.
4. resources/views/: Contains Blade templates (view files) that structure the HTML for your app.
5. database/migrations/: Contains migration files that define how your database schema evolves over time.
6. storage/: Stores logs, compiled Blade templates, and other application data.
7. vendor/: Contains all third-party packages installed via Composer.
8. .env: This file contains sensitive environment-specific configuration, such as database credentials and API keys.
