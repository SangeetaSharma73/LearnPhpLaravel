5. database/ Directory
This directory contains database-related files, such as migrations, factories, and seeders.

migrations/: Migration files contain schema changes for the database, such as creating, modifying, or dropping tables. Each migration file has a timestamp and a description (e.g., 2024_08_01_000000_create_users_table.php).
factories/: Factories are used to generate fake data for testing purposes. You can define how your model should look using factories (e.g., Faker data).
seeders/: Seeders are used to populate the database with initial data. For example, you can seed users, roles, or products for testing or development purposes.
