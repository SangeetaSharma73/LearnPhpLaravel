2. app/ Directory
This is where the core logic of your application resides. It contains controllers, models, middleware, policies, and service providers.

1. Console/: Holds Artisan console commands.

If you create custom Artisan commands, they will be placed here.
Exceptions/: Handles application-specific exceptions. The default file Handler.php contains methods to render or report exceptions.

2. Http/:

* Controllers/: This directory contains all the controllers. Controllers are responsible for handling user requests and returning responses (typically views or JSON data).
* Middleware/: Middleware filters HTTP requests entering your application. Common tasks, such as authentication, CORS handling, and CSRF protection, are handled by middleware.
- Requests/: Custom form request validation classes. These are used to validate incoming requests before they reach the controller.
- Models/: Contains Eloquent models that represent tables in your database. These are used to interact with your database.

Example: User.php, Product.php.

- Policies/: Stores authorization logic. Laravel policies provide a way to define authorization logic in a centralized place, associated with models.

- Providers/: Contains service providers. A service provider is responsible for binding things into the service container, like registering services, event listeners, etc. The AppServiceProvider.php is one of the default files that sets basic configurations for your app.
