This directory contains all the route definitions for your Laravel application. Laravel separates web, API, and console routes for better organization.

web.php: Defines the routes for web pages (typically HTTP routes). These routes are tied to controllers and return HTML views.
api.php: Contains routes for API requests (returns JSON responses).
console.php: Allows you to define custom Artisan console commands.
channels.php: Used for defining broadcast channels.
