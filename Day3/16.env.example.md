- The .env.example file in Laravel is a template that lists the required environment variables needed to run your Laravel application. It does not contain actual sensitive data (like API keys or passwords) but instead uses placeholders. This file helps ensure consistency in environment configuration across development, staging, and production environments, while keeping sensitive data out of version control systems like Git.
