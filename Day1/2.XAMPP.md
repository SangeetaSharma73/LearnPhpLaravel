# Intro of XAMPP

XAMPP is a popular open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends. It is designed to be an easy-to-install and use software package that allows developers to set up a local server environment on their own computers. Here’s a brief introduction:


# What is XAMPP?
- XAMPP stands for:

1. X: Cross-platform (works on various operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and macOS)
2. A: Apache (a widely used web server)

3. M: MySQL (a popular database management system, now replaced by MariaDB in newer versions)

4. P: PHP (a server-side scripting language)

5. P: Perl (a programming language used for various scripting tasks)



# Key Features 


- Easy Installation: XAMPP provides a straightforward installation process, allowing you to set up a local server environment with just a few clicks. It includes all the components needed to run a web server and is ideal for development and testing.

- All-in-One Package: It bundles Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, PHP, and Perl into a single package, simplifying the setup process.

- Cross-Platform: XAMPP is available for multiple operating systems, making it versatile for development across different platforms.

- Control Panel: It includes a user-friendly control panel to manage the server components (Apache, MySQL, etc.), start and stop services, and configure settings.

- Development and Testing: XAMPP is primarily used for development and testing purposes. It allows developers to test their websites and applications locally before deploying them to a live server.

- Additional Tools: XAMPP often includes additional tools like phpMyAdmin for database management, which provides a graphical interface to interact with MySQL/MariaDB databases.


# Components

- Apache: The web server that serves your web pages.

- MariaDB/MySQL: The database management system for storing and managing data.

- PHP: The scripting language used for server-side logic.

- Perl: A programming language that can be used for various scripting tasks (though less common in modern web development).

### Steps to Install and Use XAMPP for PHP:

1. **Download**:
   - Visit [Apache Friends](https://www.apachefriends.org/).

2. **Install**:
   - Run the installer.
   - Select Apache, MySQL/Mariadb , and PHP.

3. **Start XAMPP**:
   - Open the XAMPP Control Panel.
   - Start **Apache** and **MySQL**.

4. **Create PHP Project**:
   - Navigate to `C:/xampp/htdocs/`.
   
   - Create a folder for the project (e.g., `my_php_project`).
         - Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a PHP project using XAMPP in the `C:/xampp/htdocs/` folder:

         1. Navigate to `C:/xampp/htdocs/`
            Open File Explorer and go to the directory where XAMPP is installed. By default, it should be at C:/xampp/.
            Open the htdocs folder. This is where your PHP projects will be stored.

         2. Create a Project Folder
            Inside htdocs, create a new folder for your project, for example, my_php_project. You can do this by right-clicking in the folder and selecting New > Folder, then naming it my_php_project.

         3. Add an `index.php` File
            Inside the my_php_project folder, create a new file called index.php.Open the file in a text editor (such as Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code), and add the following PHP code to it:

   - Add an `index.php` file with the following content:
   
     ```php
     <?php echo "Hello, XAMPP!"; ?>
     ```
   - Access via `http://localhost/my_php_project`.

5. **Database Access**:
   - Open `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` to manage databases.

      ** query to create database in phpMyAdmin **
         *** Steps to Access phpMyAdmin:
          1. a web browser and go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin.
          2. On the top menu, click on the SQL tab to execute SQL queries.
          3. SQL Query to Create a Database:
         Here’s an example SQL query to create a new database:

            CREATE DATABASE my_database;

            USE my_database;

            CREATE TABLE users (
               id INT(11) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
               username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
               email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
               password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
               created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
            );

            INSERT INTO users (username, email, password) VALUES ('john_doe', 'john@example.com', 'password123');

            SELECT * FROM users;

            DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;

********************************************** Doubt
### Connecting PHP to MySQL:

```php
<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "";

$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password);

if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
echo "Connected successfully";
?>
