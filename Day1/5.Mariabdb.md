# MariaDB

- MariaDB is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is a fork of MySQL. It was created by the original developers of MySQL in response to concerns over Oracle Corporation’s acquisition of MySQL. MariaDB aims to remain free under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and is designed to maintain compatibility with MySQL, while also offering additional features, improved performance, and expanded capabilities.

# Key Features of MariaDB:

MySQL Compatibility: MariaDB is designed to be a drop-in replacement for MySQL. It supports the same SQL syntax and APIs, making migration from MySQL to MariaDB seamless.

Open Source: MariaDB is fully open-source and is licensed under the GNU GPL, LGPL, or BSD licenses, depending on the component.

Storage Engines:

Supports the same storage engines as MySQL (InnoDB, MyISAM) along with additional ones like Aria (for crash-safe operations) and TokuDB (for handling large datasets efficiently).
Improved Performance:

MariaDB provides performance optimizations over MySQL, such as faster replication, better query execution, and thread pooling for high concurrency.
High Availability and Replication:

Master-Slave Replication: Supports traditional master-slave replication, with improvements for faster and more reliable replication.
Galera Cluster: A synchronous multi-master cluster solution for high availability that is integrated into MariaDB.
Security Enhancements:

Enhanced security features, including encryption for databases, tables, and logs. Supports role-based access control and more advanced user account management.
JSON Functions:

Similar to MySQL, MariaDB supports JSON data types and functions, allowing you to store and query JSON documents.
Compatibility with Other SQL Standards:

MariaDB extends its compatibility with SQL standards by adding support for common table expressions (CTEs), window functions, and other SQL enhancements.
Enterprise Features:

MariaDB offers enterprise-level features such as columnar storage engines (e.g., MariaDB ColumnStore) for analytical queries, dynamic columns, and distributed database support.
Cross-Platform Support:

MariaDB can be deployed on various operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and macOS.


# Key Differences Between MariaDB and MySQL:
License: MariaDB is guaranteed to remain open-source under the GPL, while MySQL, owned by Oracle, is developed under dual licenses (open-source and proprietary).
Features: MariaDB has introduced features that are not available in MySQL, such as new storage engines and performance improvements.
Development: The MariaDB community is focused on rapid development with frequent releases and new features, while MySQL is subject to Oracle’s release schedule.
Governance: MariaDB is governed by the MariaDB Foundation, an independent organization, ensuring its development is transparent and community-driven.


# MariaDB Installation Guide

## 1. MariaDB Installation (Windows 11)

1. Download the latest MariaDB from the official site: [https://mariadb.org/download/](https://mariadb.org/download/)
2. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard.

3. Set root password and configure database options as per your needs.
 - give the path into D drive and there mariadb-port_name(but it will not take 3306 because it bydefault so you need to make the port_name 3307).

4. Add MariaDB to system PATH .
  - give the path like  `D:\Mariadb-3307\bin` into edit system variable



<!-- Connect PHP with MariaDB -->

1. Install the mysqli extension for PHP:
    
    Windows: Uncomment extension=mysqli in php.ini.
    

2. Test MariaDB connection in a PHP file:

****************************************** how to check connection

<?php
$conn = new mysqli("localhost", "root", "password", "database");

if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
echo "Connected successfully";
?>

3. Open the file in your browser to ensure the connection works.


## My Notes 

### Mariabdb

[Mariadb installation link](https://mariadb.org/download/?t=mariadb&p=mariadb&r=11.5.2&os=windows&cpu=x86_64&pkg=msi&mirror=starburst_mumbai)

1. Phpmyadmin -

[Phpmyadmin download link](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/)

1.1 XAMPP - 
1.2 Zip -> vscode -> php server extension 

2. heidisql -

[heidisql download link ](https://www.heidisql.com/download.php)

3. 3306 - 
It is by default in our system if we install the mariabdb 

4. 3307 - 
We need to make a folder in "D" drive and the folder name is Mariabdb-3307.

## my.ini


MySQL configuration file (my.ini) to ensure your Laravel 8.1 project runs efficiently, especially if you're dealing with a large database, complex queries, or large uploads. Here are the typical settings you might want to adjust in the my.ini file:


# Changes in `my.ini` for Laravel Projects

## 1. InnoDB Buffer Pool Size (`innodb_buffer_pool_size`)
Increasing the buffer pool size allows MySQL to store more data in memory, improving performance for larger databases. Set it to a higher value depending on your system's RAM (ideally 50-70% of your server’s RAM).
ini
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 1G  ; Set it to 1GB or more, depending on your available memory


## 2. Max Connections (max_connections)
Laravel applications often make multiple database connections simultaneously. Increasing this setting can help prevent "Too many connections" errors.

max_connections = 200   ; Increase the number of allowed concurrent connection

# Changes in `my.ini` for Laravel Projects


3. Query Cache Size (query_cache_size)
Enabling and adjusting query caching can improve the performance of repetitive SELECT queries.

query_cache_size = 32M    ; Adjust as per your needs (disabled in newer MySQL versions by default)


4. Max Allowed Packet (max_allowed_packet)
This setting determines the maximum size of a single packet or any generated/intermediary string. You might want to increase this if you’re dealing with large blobs of data (e.g., large file uploads).

max_allowed_packet = 64M   ; Increase this for handling large queries or uploads


5. Table Open Cache (table_open_cache)
Increase this setting to optimize performance when you have many open tables at the same time.

table_open_cache = 400   ; Increase based on the number of tables used in your application

6. Timeout Settings
6.1. Wait Timeout (wait_timeout)
The time in seconds that MySQL will wait before closing an inactive connection.
wait_timeout = 600   ; Set a higher value if you expect long-running queries


6.2. Interactive Timeout (interactive_timeout)
Similar to wait_timeout, but used for interactive sessions.
interactive_timeout = 600


7. Slow Query Log (slow_query_log)
If you're troubleshooting performance issues, enabling the slow query log can help you identify slow-running queries.

slow_query_log = 1
slow_query_log_file = "C:/path/to/slow_query.log"
long_query_time = 2   ; Log queries that take longer than 2 seconds


8. Thread Cache Size (thread_cache_size)
Increasing the thread cache size allows MySQL to reuse threads instead of creating new ones, which improves performance in high-traffic situations.

thread_cache_size = 50   ; Increase if you have a high number of concurrent users
