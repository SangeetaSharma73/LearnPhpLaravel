# PHP Installation Guide (Windows 11)

## 1. Download PHP Binaries
- Visit the official PHP website: [https://windows.php.net/download](https://windows.php.net/download)

- Download the **Thread Safe** version for the required PHP versions:
  
  - [PHP 7.4](https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-7.4.33-Win32-vc15-x64.zip)
  - [PHP 8.1](https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-8.1.21-Win32-vs16-x64.zip)

  - [PHP 8.3](https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-8.3.0-Win32-vs16-x64.zip)


## 2. Extract Files
- Extract the downloaded ZIP files to `C:\php7.4`, `C:\php8.1`, `C:\php8.2`, or `C:\php8.3`.
- I have given path to extract phpversion - `C:\php\php7.4`
- We have to make inside the php7.4 do some changes 
   - we need to copy php.ini-development and make it php.ini and uncomment some extensions

## 3. Configure PHP in System Path
1. **Right-click** on **This PC** > **Properties** > 
**Advanced system settings**.
2. Click **Environment Variables** > Select **Path** > Click **Edit**.
3. Add the path where you extracted PHP (e.g., `C:\php7.4\` or `C:\php8.1\`).
 - which path you have given to your php_version put that path into this 
4. Click **OK** to save changes.

## 4. Configure `php.ini`
- Copy `php.ini-development` to `php.ini` in the PHP directory.
- Open `php.ini` and configure the following settings:
  ```ini
  extension_dir = "ext"
  
* Enable commonly used extensions (uncomment by removing the ;):
  extension=curl
  extension=mbstring
  extension=mysqli
  extension=openssl
  extension=gd

  * Save the changes to the file.



5. Verify PHP Installation
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
Type php -v to check the installed version.
6. Switching Between PHP Versions (Optional)
To switch between versions, update the Path environment variable with the desired PHP version's directory (e.g., C:\php8.1\) and restart the terminal.

# we need to give the path of phpversion in edit the system environment variable 

`C:\PHP\Version-7.4`



* Configure Web Server (Optional)
- If you plan to use PHP with a web server like Apache or Nginx:

- For Apache: Install Apache HTTP Server.
- Edit the httpd.conf file to load PHP as a module.



# php.ini 

- The php.ini file is the main configuration file for PHP. It controls various settings for PHP, such as memory limits, error reporting, and extension management. When PHP starts, it reads the php.ini file to determine its settings. Here's a detailed guide to everything you need to know about php.ini.


# where to find

1. we can find this file in php/version8.1/php.init-development  and copy this file and make it php.ini

2. After making the php.ini file we have to make changes in extensions we need to remove `;` from some extensions

## How to run exe file?

## ANS. Go to the folder and copy the bin folder path and set it as PATH by adding it in system environment variables


## how to download cacert.pem 
[carcert installtion link](http://www.cacert.org/index.php?id=3)

## why we needed cacert.pem 

The cacert.pem file is used to ensure secure communication over HTTPS by providing a collection of trusted Certificate Authority (CA) certificates. Here's why it's important:

SSL/TLS Verification: When an application makes an HTTPS request, it needs to verify the authenticity of the server it’s connecting to. This is done using SSL/TLS certificates issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs). The cacert.pem file contains a list of these trusted certificates.

Preventing Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: By verifying that the server’s certificate is signed by a trusted CA, the cacert.pem file helps prevent attacks where an attacker might try to intercept and manipulate the communication between your application and the server.

Ensuring Secure Data Transmission: Using a verified certificate ensures that the data being transmitted between the client and server is encrypted and secure from eavesdropping or tampering.

Applications Usage: Tools and libraries that handle HTTPS connections (like requests in Python, curl, or web browsers) use the cacert.pem file to verify that the certificates they encounter are from a trusted source.


# path this file-
 - we have give the path there where we have made the Version8.1,Version8.2 etc.

 

 ##  Configure php.ini -
- To successfully run a Laravel 8.1 project, you need to ensure that specific PHP extensions are enabled in your php.ini file. Here are the necessary extensions that should be uncommented to avoid errors:

# Key PHP Extensions for Laravel 8.1:
* OpenSSL
- Laravel uses OpenSSL for encryption. Uncomment:
ini
`extension=openssl`

* PDO
- Laravel relies on PDO for database interactions. Uncomment:
ini

extension=pdo
extension=pdo_mysql  ; (for MySQL)
extension=pdo_sqlite ; (if you are using SQLite)


* Mbstring
- Laravel uses the mbstring extension for string manipulations. Uncomment:

ini
extension=mbstring


* Tokenizer
Tokenizer is required for handling tokens. Uncomment:

ini
extension=tokenizer

* XML
The XML extension is required for several Laravel functionalities. Uncomment:

ini
extension=xml


* Ctype
This extension is used for character type checks. Uncomment:

ini

extension=ctype

* JSON
Laravel uses JSON for handling JSON data structures. Uncomment:

ini
extension=json

* Fileinfo
The fileinfo extension helps Laravel with file uploads and MIME type detection. Uncomment:

ini
extension=fileinfo

* BCMath
For precise mathematical calculations, enable BCMath:

ini
extension=bcmath


* GD or Imagick (for image processing)
- If your project handles images, enable either GD or Imagick:

ini
Copy code
extension=gd    ; GD library
extension=imagick ; If you prefer using Imagick


* Zip
- Laravel might use ZIP archives for packaging. Uncomment:

ini
extension=zip

* Redis (optional, if you use Redis caching)

ini
extension=redis


* Sodium (optional, for encryption features)

ini

extension=sodium


# How to Enable These Extensions:
- Open your php.ini file, which is typically located in the PHP installation directory.
F- ind the relevant extensions by searching for their names in the file.
- Remove the semicolon (;) at the beginning of the line for each extension to uncomment it.
- Save the file and restart your web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx).

# After Enabling Extensions:
- Composer Update: Run composer install or composer update to ensure all Laravel dependencies are correctly installed.
- Server Restart: Restart your local server or PHP service to apply the changes.
- Check Requirements: Run php artisan to confirm the environment is properly configured for Laravel.
This should set up your Laravel project smoothly.







* we have to increase the size of some extension give me that also and we also give path of cacert in php.ini for two places

- To ensure your Laravel 8.1 project runs without errors, you may need to increase the size limits for certain extensions and provide the correct path for the cacert.pem file in your php.ini for SSL verification.

# Increasing Size for Some Extensions:
## Upload Maximum File Size (upload_max_filesize):
- This setting controls the maximum size of files that can be uploaded. If your application allows large file uploads (e.g., images, PDFs), increase this limit.

ini

`upload_max_filesize = 50M  ` ; Change to a value that fits your needs (e.g., 50M)


## Post Maximum Size (post_max_size):
- This controls the maximum size of POST data that can be sent to the server. It should be greater than or equal to upload_max_filesize if you're allowing file uploads.

ini
post_max_size = 50M   ; Set to match or exceed upload_max_filesize


## Memory Limit (memory_limit):
- The memory limit defines how much memory PHP can allocate for running scripts. If you encounter "Out of memory" errors, increase this value.

ini
memory_limit = 256M   ; Increase based on your server's available resources

## Maximum Execution Time (max_execution_time):
- This defines the maximum time a script is allowed to run before being terminated. You can increase this value for operations that may take longer (like large file uploads or complex database queries).

ini
max_execution_time = 120   ; Set it to a higher value if your scripts take longer


## Maximum Input Time (max_input_time):
Controls the maximum time PHP will spend parsing input data (POST, GET, file uploads). You can increase this if your application handles large amounts of data.

ini
max_input_time = 120   ; Increase based on the complexity of your input data


## Providing cacert.pem Path in php.ini:
For secure connections (like HTTPS or API requests via cURL), PHP needs to verify SSL certificates using a CA certificate bundle (cacert.pem). You should specify the correct path for the cacert.pem file in two places within your php.ini:

### cURL CA Info (curl.cainfo):

ini

curl.cainfo = "C:/path/to/cacert.pem"

### OpenSSL CA Info (openssl.cafile):

ini
openssl.cafile = "C:/path/to/cacert.pem"

## Note: Replace "C:/path/to/cacert.pem" with the actual path where your cacert.pem file is located.

You can download the cacert.pem file from here if you don't have it.

Example Summary of Changes in php.ini:
ini

; Path to CA certificate bundle for verifying SSL
curl.cainfo = "C:/path/to/cacert.pem"
openssl.cafile = "C:/path/to/cacert.pem"

; Increase upload size limits
upload_max_filesize = 50M
post_max_size = 50M

; Memory and time limits
memory_limit = 256M
max_execution_time = 120
max_input_time = 120

- Restarting the Server:
After making these changes, restart your web server (Apache/Nginx) or PHP service to apply the updated configurations.
