In Laravel, scopes are a way to encapsulate commonly used query logic within your Eloquent models. They allow you to define reusable query constraints, making your code more readable and maintainable. There are two types of scopes in Laravel:

Local Scopes: Define reusable query logic that can be invoked in a chainable fashion.
Global Scopes: Automatically apply query conditions to every query for a given model.
1. Local Scopes
A local scope is a method that you define in an Eloquent model to encapsulate a specific query logic that you might reuse throughout your application.

How to Create and Use Local Scopes:
Define a Scope in a Model: A local scope is a method that starts with the prefix scope followed by a meaningful name. For example, scopeActive:

php
Copy code
class User extends Model
{
    public function scopeActive($query)
    {
        return $query->where('status', 'active');
    }
}
Using a Local Scope: You can invoke the scope method without the scope prefix when querying the model:

php
Copy code
$activeUsers = User::active()->get();
This will apply the query logic defined in the scopeActive method, i.e., filtering users where the status column is 'active'.

Passing Parameters to a Scope: You can also pass parameters to the scope method to make it more dynamic.

php
Copy code
class User extends Model
{
    public function scopeStatus($query, $status)
    {
        return $query->where('status', $status);
    }
}
Now, you can pass the desired status when querying:

php
Copy code
$inactiveUsers = User::status('inactive')->get();
2. Global Scopes
A global scope automatically applies a query constraint to all queries for a particular model. For example, you might want to ensure that only active records are returned from a table without having to explicitly specify the condition in every query.

How to Create and Use Global Scopes:
Define a Global Scope: To define a global scope, you create a class that implements Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Scope and apply it to the model.

php
Copy code
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Scope;

class ActiveScope implements Scope
{
    public function apply(Builder $builder, Model $model)
    {
        $builder->where('status', 'active');
    }
}
Apply the Global Scope in a Model: You can apply the global scope in your model’s booted() method.

php
Copy code
class User extends Model
{
    protected static function booted()
    {
        static::addGlobalScope(new ActiveScope);
    }
}
Now, every query on the User model will automatically apply the condition WHERE status = 'active'.

Disabling Global Scopes: If you need to temporarily disable a global scope for a query, you can use the withoutGlobalScope or withoutGlobalScopes methods.

php
Copy code
// Disable a specific global scope
$users = User::withoutGlobalScope(ActiveScope::class)->get();

// Disable all global scopes
$users = User::withoutGlobalScopes()->get();
Use Cases for Scopes:
Local Scopes are useful for conditions that may be reused often, like filtering active users, filtering posts by category, or retrieving recent records.
Global Scopes are suitable for applying restrictions across all queries for a model, like showing only active products or filtering soft-deleted records by default.
Example: Local Scope for Popular Products
Let’s say you want to filter "popular" products that have been purchased more than 100 times:

Define the local scope in the Product model:

php
Copy code
class Product extends Model
{
    public function scopePopular($query)
    {
        return $query->where('purchases', '>', 100);
    }
}
Use the scope in a query:

php
Copy code
$popularProducts = Product::popular()->get();
Summary:
Local Scopes encapsulate reusable query logic that can be chained in your queries (e.g., User::active()).
Global Scopes automatically apply a query condition to all queries for a model (e.g., User::withoutTrashed() in a soft delete setup).
