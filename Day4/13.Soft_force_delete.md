In Laravel, soft deletes and force deletes are methods for handling record deletion in a more flexible and reversible manner. Here’s what they mean:

Soft Delete
A soft delete in Laravel allows you to "delete" a record from the database without actually removing it. Instead of permanently deleting the record, a deleted_at timestamp is added to the record, marking it as deleted. This way, the record still exists in the database, but it won't appear in normal queries unless explicitly included.

How Soft Deletes Work:
Migration Setup: To enable soft deletes, you need to add a deleted_at column to your table in the migration file. Here's an example:

php
Copy code
Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->softDeletes(); // Adds the `deleted_at` column
});
Model Setup: In your model, use the SoftDeletes trait to enable this behavior.

php
Copy code
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletes;

class User extends Model
{
    use SoftDeletes;
}
Soft Deleting a Record: When you delete a record using delete(), it won’t be permanently removed; instead, the deleted_at column is filled with a timestamp.

php
Copy code
$user = User::find(1);
$user->delete(); // Marks the record as deleted by setting `deleted_at`
Querying Soft-Deleted Records: By default, soft-deleted records are excluded from queries. To include them or fetch only soft-deleted records, you can use these methods:

With Trashed: Includes both soft-deleted and non-deleted records in the results.

php
Copy code
$users = User::withTrashed()->get();
Only Trashed: Retrieves only the soft-deleted records.

php
Copy code
$users = User::onlyTrashed()->get();
Restoring a Soft-Deleted Record: You can restore a soft-deleted record by using the restore() method.

php
Copy code
$user = User::withTrashed()->find(1);
$user->restore(); // Removes the `deleted_at` timestamp, making the record active again
Force Delete
A force delete permanently removes a record from the database, bypassing the soft delete mechanism. Once a record is force deleted, it cannot be restored.

How Force Delete Works:
Force Deleting a Record: To completely remove a record from the database, you use the forceDelete() method. This method does not set the deleted_at timestamp but actually deletes the record from the table.

php
Copy code
$user = User::withTrashed()->find(1);
$user->forceDelete(); // Permanently deletes the record
Summary:
Soft Delete: Marks a record as deleted by setting the deleted_at column. The record remains in the database and can be restored.
Force Delete: Permanently removes a record from the database without the possibility of restoring it.
This allows flexibility in data handling, providing options for reversible deletions and permanent deletions when needed.
