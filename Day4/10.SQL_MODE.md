1. SQL Mode in MariaDB/MySQL
- In MariaDB/MySQL, SQL mode is a setting that determines how MySQL should behave when processing queries, particularly regarding error handling, default values, and strict data validation. Different modes control aspects like data truncation, null handling, and invalid data input.

- In Laravel, the SQL mode affects how database operations are handled. Laravel's database configuration may need to be adjusted to match the SQL mode settings in your database server to avoid unwanted errors or warnings.

# Some of the common SQL modes are:

- STRICT_TRANS_TABLES: Rejects queries that would result in invalid or out-of-range values being inserted. Laravel expects this to be enabled for strict validation.
- NO_ZERO_IN_DATE: Disallows dates where month or day is set to zero.
- NO_ZERO_DATE: Disallows the ‘0000-00-00’ date value, often used in MySQL.
- ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO: Generates an error if division by zero occurs.
- ANSI_QUOTES: Treats double quotes as identifier delimiters, which can cause issues with Laravel if not handled properly.

- You can adjust the SQL mode in the MariaDB/MySQL configuration file (my.ini or my.cnf) like this:'

[mysqld]
sql_mode=STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,NO_ZERO_DATE,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,ANSI_QUOTES


2. InnoDB Strict Mode
- InnoDB Strict Mode controls whether InnoDB accepts or rejects certain types of invalid or incorrect data. In strict mode, InnoDB will raise an error and reject operations that involve invalid data types or incorrect foreign key constraints.

- InnoDB Strict Mode On: This ensures better data integrity by preventing silent truncations and other invalid operations. It enforces the strictest level of data validation.
- InnoDB Strict Mode Off: The database allows certain operations that may introduce data issues, such as truncating data silently without throwing errors.
- Laravel assumes strict mode is on, and it can lead to fewer unexpected behaviors in your application by rejecting invalid data immediately.

- To enable or disable it, edit your MariaDB/MySQL configuration file (my.ini or my.cnf):

[mysqld]
innodb_strict_mode = 1  # Enables strict mode
