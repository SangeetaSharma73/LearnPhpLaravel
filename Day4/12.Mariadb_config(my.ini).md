#  MariaDB Configuration (my.ini)
- In the MariaDB configuration file (my.ini for Windows, my.cnf for Linux), you can set several parameters to fine-tune your database for performance. Here are some configurations that can be useful for optimizing MariaDB, particularly with Laravel applications:

- Increasing Timeout: If you encounter timeout issues while executing large queries, you can increase the wait_timeout and interactive_timeout values to prevent the server from closing connections prematurely.

ini

[mysqld]
wait_timeout=28800
interactive_timeout=28800

- Max Packet Size: If you are uploading large files or running queries that generate large data, increasing the max_allowed_packet size is important.

ini

[mysqld]
max_allowed_packet=64M

- Buffer Pool Size: For improving performance, increase the InnoDB Buffer Pool Size. It caches data and indexes, reducing the need to read from disk.

ini

[mysqld]
innodb_buffer_pool_size=1G


7. How to Increase Time in MariaDB (my.ini)
- If you need to adjust connection or query execution times in MariaDB to prevent timeouts (particularly during large operations), you can modify the following parameters in the my.ini file under the [mysqld] section:

- max_execution_time: Defines the maximum time for query execution.
- innodb_lock_wait_timeout: Controls the time InnoDB waits for row locks.
Example:

ini
[mysqld]
max_execution_time = 30000   # 30 seconds
innodb_lock_wait_timeout = 50
- This ensures longer queries or operations wonâ€™t timeout too quickly.
