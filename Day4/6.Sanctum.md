# Laravel Sanctum

- Laravel Sanctum is a package for API token authentication in Laravel applications. It provides a simple and lightweight authentication system for single-page applications (SPAs), mobile apps, and simple API projects. Sanctum allows you to issue API tokens to users and authenticate requests using these tokens.

## Key Features

### Token Authentication

Sanctum allows you to create and manage API tokens. These tokens can be used to authenticate API requests.

### SPA Authentication

It supports SPA authentication using cookies. This is useful for Laravel applications that serve both the backend and frontend, where the frontend is built using a framework like Vue.js or React.

### Simple and Lightweight

Unlike Laravel Passport, which is more feature-rich but complex, Sanctum is designed to be simple and lightweight, making it easier to set up and use.

### Ability to Define Scopes

You can define scopes for your tokens to specify what actions a token is permitted to perform.

### Token Abilities

Sanctum allows you to assign abilities to tokens and check these abilities in your application's logic.

## Installation and Setup

To use Laravel Sanctum, follow these steps:

1. **Install Sanctum**
   
   You can install Sanctum via Composer:

   - bash
   `composer require laravel/sanctum`


# Publish Sanctum's Configuration

- Publish the Sanctum configuration file:

- bash

`php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Laravel\Sanctum\SanctumServiceProvider"`

# Run Migrations

- Run the migrations to create the necessary tables:

bash

`php artisan migrate`
- Set Up Sanctum Middleware

- Add Sanctum's middleware to your api middleware group in app/Http/Kernel.php:

php

'api' => [
    \Laravel\Sanctum\Http\Middleware\EnsureFrontendRequestsAreStateful::class,
    'throttle:api',
    \Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\SubstituteBindings::class,
],

- Use the HasApiTokens Trait

- Add the HasApiTokens trait to your User model:

php

use Laravel\Sanctum\HasApiTokens;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasApiTokens, Notifiable;
}
- Generating and Using Tokens
- Generate Tokens

- You can generate tokens for users using the createToken method:

php

$user = User::find(1);
$token = $user->createToken('Personal Access Token')->plainTextToken;
Authenticate Requests

Use the auth:sanctum middleware to protect your routes. For example:

php

Route::middleware('auth:sanctum')->get('/user', function (Request $request) {
    return $request->user();
});
Token Abilities

- You can assign abilities to tokens and check them:

php

$token = $user->createToken('Token Name', ['server:update'])->plainTextToken;
To check abilities:

php
Copy code
if ($request->user()->tokenCan('server:update')) {
    // Token has 'server:update' ability
}

# Summary
