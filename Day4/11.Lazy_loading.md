3. Lazy Loading
- Lazy Loading is an Eloquent feature in Laravel where related models are only loaded when they are accessed for the first time. This is the default behavior in Laravel and helps to avoid unnecessary database queries.

Example:

php

`$user = User::find(1);`
`$posts = $user->posts;` // At this point, Laravel will run a query to load the posts related to the user.

- Drawback of Lazy Loading: If you are iterating over multiple models and accessing related models in each iteration, this can lead to the "N+1 query problem." For instance, fetching a user and then iterating over the user’s posts will cause one query for the user and N queries for the posts, leading to performance issues.

4. Preventing Lazy Loading
- To prevent the N+1 problem, Laravel allows Eager Loading, which loads related models together with the main model in a single query.

Example of Eager Loading:

php

`$user = User::with('posts')->find(1);` // This will load the user and posts in a single query.
- Laravel introduced an option in version 8.69 to prevent lazy loading entirely during development or testing:

php

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

Model::preventLazyLoading();

- This ensures that you explicitly define related models when needed and prevents accidental N+1 query issues in production environments.

5. Lazy Loading in Laravel 9+
- In Laravel 9 and later versions, lazy loading is prevented by default in non-production environments. This means if you attempt to access a related model that hasn’t been explicitly loaded, Laravel will throw an exception to remind you to use eager loading.
