# Elogquent :
- Eloquent is a built-in object-relational mapper (ORM) in the Laravel framework that helps developers interact with databases. It provides a simple, intuitive syntax for performing common database operations, such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting records. 
 
## Here are some things you can do with Eloquent: 
 
- Create models: Each database table has a corresponding model that you can use to interact with that table. 
 
- Delete models: You can delete models to make an application more efficient. 
 
- Chunk results: Use the chunk method to process large numbers of models more efficiently. 
 
- Cursors: Use the cursor method to reduce memory consumption when iterating through model records. 
 
- Advanced subqueries: Use subquery functionality to pull information from related tables in a single query.
